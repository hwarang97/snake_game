## Why can't variable be used when declaring an array?
Unlike python, error occurs when I use variable in array. 
```c
int main()
{
	int row = 20;
	int col = 30;
	char board[row][col];

	return 0;
}
```

Use macro instead of hard coding

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define ROW 20
#define COL 30

int main() 
{

	char board[ROW][COL];
	for (int i = 0; i < ROW; i++)
	{
		for (int j = 0; j < COL; j++)
		{
			if ((i == 0) || (i == ROW-1) || (j == 0) || (j == COL -1)) {
				board[i][j] = '#';
			}
			else
			{
				board[i][j] = ' ';
			}
		}
	}
```

## What is difference between runtime and compile time?
Compile time is process of build. When you make source code, it would be execuable by compile and linking. The period is called __compiletime__.
After execuable is created, it can be executed. When it exectued, the executable is loaded to memory and performed by cpu. This period is called __runtime__.
